# MondoGcmPush
A small Sinatra server that converts transaction webhook notifications
from the [Mondo API](https://getmondo.co.uk/docs) into GCM push notifications.


This is used to enable push notifications for the [MondoAndroid app](https://github.com/joluet/MondoAndroid).

This Sinatra app stores pairs of GCM registration ids and Mondo account ids that are send to the `/token` endpoint as a `PUT` request. The body of such a `PUT` request should look like this:
```json
{
"account_id": "a_mondo_account_id", 
"token" :     "a_gcm_registration_id"
}
```

The app then forwards the body of any `POST` request that is send to `/push` in form of a GCM push notification to a registration id that corresponds to the Mondo account id provided in the body of the `POST` request. The Mondo API sends such a `POST` request to registered webhooks when a new transaction has been created. See the [Mondo API docs](https://getmondo.co.uk/docs/#webhooks) for details. The body is expected to look like this:
```json
{
    "type": "transaction.created",
    "data": {
        "account_id": "a_mondo_account_id",
        "amount": -350,
